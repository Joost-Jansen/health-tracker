"""Example data for the first-run walk: a shared, read-only example account with made-up data.

The walk past the pages (web/components/onboarding/Welcome.tsx) would show a new account empty pages, so while it is on a
page step the site sends `X-Example-Data: 1`. For a site login (session cookie) that header makes the data routes in
`EXAMPLE_PATHS` read from the example account instead of the caller's own data. Everything else stays the caller's own:
who you are, account, agent tokens, connections, onboarding, feedback. Admin, MCP and agent-token routes, and every
request with a Bearer agent token, ignore the header. Any write that carries the header is refused (403
`example_read_only`, see `refuse_writes`), so example mode can never change anyone's data.

The example account lives in its own SQLite database, apart from the users' database, and is opened read-only
(`mode=ro`). It is made on first use with `scripts/seed_demo.py` (fixed random seeds, so the same day always gives the
same data) around a made-up start point, and made again when the date changes so it always ends today. Nothing in it
comes from a real person.
