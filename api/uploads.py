"""Upload FIT files: activities that are not on Garmin (a Wahoo bike computer, Zwift, a friend's watch).

One file per request, as the raw body (no multipart dependency): `POST /api/activities/upload?name=<file name>`.
A .fit or a .zip with one inside. An activity that starts within two minutes of one we already have (the same ride
synced from Garmin) is merged into it, not added twice; Garmin's values stay leading, see tools.store priorities.
