"""The real client address behind a reverse proxy, without trusting headers anyone can send.

`CF-Connecting-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` are plain request headers: a visitor who reaches the app directly (or over a
VPN listener of the proxy) can set them to any value and so dodge a per-IP limit. They are only believed when the
socket peer is one of the configured proxies (TRUSTED_PROXIES, comma-separated IPs or CIDRs). Without that setting the
socket peer is the client.
