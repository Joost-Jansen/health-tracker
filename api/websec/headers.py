"""Security headers on every response, set by the app itself so they are there with or without a proxy in front.

    app.add_middleware(SecurityHeadersMiddleware, csp="default-src 'self'; ...", hsts=cookie_secure)

A response that already carries a Content-Security-Policy keeps it: a page with its own policy (for instance one with
the hashes of its inline scripts) wins over the app-wide default. HSTS only when the site is served over https
(`hsts=True`): over plain http browsers ignore it, and sending it from a dev server is pointless.
