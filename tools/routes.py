"""Recognise recurring routes ("vaste rondjes") from GPS tracks, for runs and for rides.

A run or ride is reduced to a shape: start, end, distance and the set of ~100 m
grid cells it passes. Two are the same route when they cover mostly the same
cells and have a similar distance, wherever they start: riders and runners often start the
tracker on the bike only once out of town, at a different spot each time, and
a watch can start late on a run. Rides allow more difference in distance and in
the extra stretch of the longer one. A cluster of at least MIN_COUNT[sport]
activities becomes a route; its medoid (the member most like all others) is the
route's "average" track, the other members are its variations. Route ids carry a prefix per sport
(r1, r2, ... for runs; f1, f2, ... for rides) so both live in one routes table.
