// Bars side by side along an axis you read yourself: months, years, or the
// twelve calendar months. One bar may consist of several pieces
// (received + still expected), stacked.
//
// Divs and not svg, unlike LineChart and ValueChart. Those two stretch one
// viewBox with preserveAspectRatio="none" across the card: fine for a
// line, but it also distorts the rounding of a bar top and the width of a
// gap, and those two carry the meaning here. Flexbox keeps every bar
// equally wide and every gap exactly 2px, on every screen.
//
// The readout line sits above the chart, not as a floating tooltip on it. A
// tooltip that appears next to the last bar falls off the screen on a phone,
// and one that flips back for that jumps. This line always has the same
// height: at rest it shows the summary, with a finger on a bar it shows that
// bar. So the chart does not move when you touch it.
