/**
 * The head of a chart card: one big number, one coloured line, one quiet one.
 *
 * A component and not three branches in place, because the *shape* must be the
 * same in all three states: at rest, with one finger on the line, and with two.
 * It was not: at rest "return …" and "deposits …" fell on two lines, while one
 * finger produced one shorter line, so the chart jumped up as soon as you
 * touched it and down again as soon as you put the second finger down.
 * Below sm the three pieces are now three lines by construction, not by the
 * chance of what fits; from sm up it is one line on the shared baseline.
 *
 * Lived in the dashboard page, where it was written; the price card on a
 * position page reads out in exactly the same way and needs the same fixed
 * height.
