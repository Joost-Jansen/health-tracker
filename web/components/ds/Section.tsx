// The ruled section: the signature element of this design, and the reason the
// app will soon have almost no cards left.
//
// A section is: an 11px small-caps label above a full-width rule, with the
// content beneath it. No box. An ink rule (--n-800) for what is primary, a
// hairline for what is secondary, and once per screen a 2px terracotta rule
// for the block that asks for your attention.
//
// This replaces components/Card.tsx in the forty places where the card was only
// drawing a border. A real card (ds-card) remains for what genuinely floats:
// dialogs and menus.
